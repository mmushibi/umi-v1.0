Current Status:
The compilation errors have been significantly reduced from the original 259+ errors.
The main issues that were resolved include:

1. AccountController.cs - Fixed type mismatches in user ID comparisons
2. AuthController.cs - Fixed JWT token generation and UserSession properties
3. Entities.cs - Added missing navigation properties and fields
4. User.cs - Fixed User model consistency
5. Program.cs - Removed DataSeeder static type conflicts

Next Steps:
1. Review any remaining compilation errors
2. Test the application functionality
3. Run database migrations if needed
4. Configure JWT settings for production

The backend should now be significantly more stable and compilable.
Most of the core functionality should work without compilation errors.
